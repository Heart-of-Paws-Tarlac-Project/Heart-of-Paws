# Heart of Paws Initiative

The increasing number of stray and abandoned dogs in Tarlac City has become a serious issue, with many left to survive on the streets without proper care, food, or shelter. Local shelters struggle with limited resources, making it difficult to accommodate and rehabilitate these animals. Despite efforts to rescue and provide homes for stray dogs, many people still prefer buying from breeders rather than adopting, leading to overcrowded shelters and a growing stray population. Lack of awareness about responsible pet ownership further contributes to the problem, as some owners abandon their pets due to unforeseen challenges. 

Heart of Paws is an initiative dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming stray and abandoned dogs by promoting adoption and responsible pet ownership. The project provides a platform where potential adopters can view available dogs, learn about the adoption process, and understand the responsibilities of pet ownership. Additionally, it encourages community involvement through volunteer programs, donation drives, and foster care opportunities to support rescued dogs in their journey to finding a permanent home. By increasing awareness and making the adoption process more accessible, Heart of Paws aims to reduce the number of stray dogs in Tarlac City while fostering a culture of compassion and care for animals.

## Techonologies and Frameworks
###AngularJS -  Used for developing the frontend, allowing dynamic rendering of pages such as pet listings and adoption forms. Furthermore, it is also used to handle user interactions and display updates in the UI dynamically.

###NodeJS -  Powers the backend, using its non-blocking runtime for handling API requests related to pet data, user registrations, and adoption processes.

###ExpressJS - Used to define and manage routes for handling RESTful API requests, such as retrieving adoptable pets and submitting adoption applications.

###MongoDB - Stores data such as pet profiles, adoption records, user details, and donations. It supports quick data retrieval and updates as users interact with the platform. The flexible schema allows for changes to data structures without requiring significant changes to the application. MongoDB handles large amounts of data, making it suitable for tracking and managing the growing number of pets, users, and adoption activities. It also provides scalability to accommodate future growth of the Heart of Paws initiative.

###Tailwind CSS - Used for styling the application, providing utility classes to design a responsive layout for the site, including the homepage, pet listings, and contact forms.
