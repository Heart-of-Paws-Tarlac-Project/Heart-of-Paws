Background

 The increasing number of stray and abandoned dogs in Tarlac City has become a serious issue,
with many left to survive on the streets without proper care, food, or shelter. Local shelters struggle
with limited resources, making it difficult to accommodate and rehabilitate these animals. Despite
efforts to rescue and provide homes for stray dogs, many people still prefer buying from breeders
rather than adopting, leading to overcrowded shelters and a growing stray population. Lack of
awareness about responsible pet ownership further contributes to the problem, as some owners
abandon their pets due to unforeseen challenges.
Heart of Paws is an initiative dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming stray and
abandoned dogs by promoting adoption and responsible pet ownership. The project provides a
platform where potential adopters can view available dogs, learn about the adoption process, and
understand the responsibilities of pet ownership. Additionally, it encourages community involvement
through volunteer programs, donation drives, and foster care opportunities to support rescued dogs in
their journey to finding a permanent home. By increasing awareness and making the adoption process
more accessible, Heart of Paws aims to reduce the number of stray dogs in Tarlac City while fostering
a culture of compassion and care for animals.
